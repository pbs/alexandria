      <h2>2) &ldquo;Where can I find the transcript for a particular story or program?&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>As the national membership organization of public television stations, PBS acquires program rights and distributes programs to its member stations. Due to the fact that PBS is not a production entity, we unfortunately are not able to help you with your transcript request.</p>
      <p>You might want to visit the program web site or contact the producers of the program you are interested in directly to see if you may obtain a transcript. Contact information for most PBS shows can be found on the individual program web site or the PBS Program Contacts page at&#58;</p>

      <h2>3) Closed Captioning Quality Certification</h2>
      <p>All programming provided by the Public Broadcasting Service (“PBS”) complies with the closed captioning requirements established by the Federal Communications Commission as embodied in 47 C.F.R. § 79.1, including regulations concerning closed captioning quality. Programming provided by PBS complies with these regulations by either&#58; (i) satisfying the caption quality standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 79.1(j)(2); (ii) adopting and following the “Video Programmer Best Practices” set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 79.1(k)(1); or (iii) being subject to one or more of the captioning exemptions set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 79.1(d), including programming for which the audio is in a language other than English or Spanish and that is not scripted programming that can be captioned using the “electronic news room” technique; interstitial material, promotional announcements, and public service announcements that are 10 minutes or less in duration; and/or programming that consists primarily of non-vocal music.</p>
